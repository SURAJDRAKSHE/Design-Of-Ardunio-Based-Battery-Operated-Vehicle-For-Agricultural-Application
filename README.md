# Design Of Ardunio Based Battery Operated Vehicle For Agricultural Application

INTRODUCTION:
Cropping is important and tedious activity for any farmer, and for large scale this activity is so lengthy, also it needs more workers. Thus agricultural battery operated vehicle are
developed to simplify the human efforts. In manual method of seed planting, we get results such as low seed placement, less spacing, less efficiencies and serious back ache for the farmers. This also limits the size of field that can be planted. Hence for achieving best performance from a seed planter, the above limits should be optimized. Thus we need to make proper design of the agricultural battery operated vehicle and also proper selection of components. Various machines are used in the traditional method of agriculture. The agriculture is the backbone of India. And for sustainable growth of India, development of agriculture plays vital role. India has huge population and day by day it is growing, thus demand of food is also increasing. Since long ago in India traditional method is used. Also India has huge man power. This manual planting ispopular in villages of India. But for large scale this method is very troublesome. The farmer has to spend his more time in planting. But time available is less for him. Thus it requires more man power to complete the task within stipulated time which is costlier. Also there will be seed wastage during manual planting. Hence there is need of developing such an battery operated vehicle which will help the farmer to reduce his efforts while planting.

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Broadcasting method does not ensure a uniform distribution of the seeds in efficient way. Seeds cannot be placed at regular distance, due to which wastage of large amount of seeds takes
place. Also for traditional method of seed sowing process, man power is required and also it is time consuming.

OBJECTIVES:-
 To build seed sowing battery operated vehicle which can be operated by the single operator.
 To enable the vehicle for the sowing of several seeds like corn, wheat etc.
 To maintain the same distance between two seeds at the time of sowing process.
 To level the ground in small extent.
